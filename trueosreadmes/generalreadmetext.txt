----- How to file issues or feature requests -----

Due to the number of repositories under the TrueOS "umbrella", the TrueOS Project consolidates its issue trackers into a few repositories:

* trueos-core (https://github.com/trueos/trueos-core) : Used for general TrueOS issues, Pico issues, feature
  requests, and TrueOS website issues.
* lumina (https://github.com/trueos/lumina) : Issues related to using the Lumina Desktop Environment
* (coming soon) sysadm (https://github.com/trueos/sysadm) : Issues with using the SysAdm client or server.
* trueos-docs (https://github.com/trueos/trueos-docs) : Issues related to the TrueOS Handbook.
* lumina-docs (https://github.com/trueos/lumina-docs) : Issues related to the Lumina Handbook.
* sysadm-docs (https://github.com/trueos/sysadm-docs) : Issues related to the SysAdm API Guide, Client, and Server 
   Handbooks.

To request a feature open a new issue and begin the title with "Feature Request:".
