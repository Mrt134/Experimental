"The primary consideration for these ads is to avoid detracting from the user"

"be limited to the navigation sidebar, and only in a predefined space "
"underneath all other navigation options. We are resolved to protect user "
"privacy and security, and do not collect user information, with the "
"exception of click throughs. Furthermore, we do not collect any data for "
"targeted ads, and are committed to only show high quality ads pertaining to "
"our user base."
