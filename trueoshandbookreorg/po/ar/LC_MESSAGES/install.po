"**Pool:** A collection of devices that provides physical storage and data "
"replication managed by ZFS. This pooled storage model eliminates the concept"
" of volumes and the associated problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted "
"bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a "
"common storage pool, each one consuming only as much space as it actually "
"needs. The combined I/O bandwidth of all devices in the pool is available to"
" all filesystems at all times. The `Storage Pools Recommendations "
"<http://www.solarisinternals.com/wiki/index.php/ZFS_Best_Practices_Guide#ZFS_Storage_Pools_Recommendations>`_"
" of the ZFS Best Practices Guide provides detailed recommendations for "
"creating the storage pool."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:395
msgid ""
"**Mirror:** A form of RAID where all data is mirrored onto two or more "
"disks, creating a redundant copy should a disk fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:401
msgid ""
"**RAIDZ2:** Double-parity ZFS software solution similar to RAID6 as it "
"allows two disks to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of 4 disks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:405
msgid ""
"**RAIDZ3:** Triple-parity ZFS software solution. RAIDZ3 offers three parity "
"drives and can operate in degraded mode if up to three drives fail with no "
"restrictions on which drives can fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:409
msgid ""
"**Dataset:** Once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A "
"dataset is similar to a folder as it supports permissions. A dataset is also"
" similar to a filesystem since properties such as quotas and compression can"
" be set."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:414
msgid ""
"**Snapshot:** A read-only, point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can"
" be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up very "
"little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed takes 0 MB"
" of storage, but if a 10 GB file is changed, it will keep a copy of both the"
" old and the new 10 GB version. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a "
"history of files, should an older copy or even a deleted file need to be "
"recovered. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. "
"every 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and "
"store them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to "
"roll the system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss,"
" an off-site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot "
"interval (e.g. within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can be cloned "
"or rolled back, but the files on the snapshot can not be accessed "
"independently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:430
msgid ""
"**Clone:** A writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the "
"same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space-efficient way to store "
"many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software "
"installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of"
" the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the "
"clone is created in the ZFS pool. Because a clone initially shares all its "
"disk space with the original snapshot, its used property is initially zero. "
"As changes are made to the clone, it uses more space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:440
msgid ""
"**ZIL:** A filesystem journal that manages writes. The ZIL is a temporary "
"storage area for sync writes until they are written asynchronously to the "
"ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as from a database "
"server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated log device known "
"as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync writes, a SLOG will "
"not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log device, it is recommended"
" to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank of capacitors that can "
"handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the SSD. If a dedicated log "
"device is needed, the SSD should be half the size of system RAM, as anything"
" larger is unused capacity. Note a dedicated log device can not be shared "
"between ZFS pools and the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache "
"device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:454
msgid ""
"**L2ARC:** ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is "
"dedicated as a cache device, it is known as an L2ARC and ZFS uses it to "
"store more reads which can increase random read performance. However, adding"
" a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will "
"actually decrease performance, as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of "
"L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as "
"possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device."
" If a lot of applications do large amounts of random reads on a dataset "
"small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be increased by "
"adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if the working "
"set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a significant "
"percentage of it will fit on the SSD. Note a dedicated L2ARC device can not "
"be shared between ZFS pools."

#~ "bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a "

#~ " file. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. every"
#~ " 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and store "
#~ "them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to roll the"
#~ " system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss, an off-"

#~ "log device known as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync "
#~ "writes, a SLOG will not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log "
#~ "device, it is recommended to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank "
#~ "of capacitors that can handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the "
#~ "SSD. If you decide to create a dedicated log device, the SSD should be half "
#~ "the size of system RAM as anything larger than that is unused capacity. Note"

#~ " a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will "
#~ "actually decrease performance as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of "
#~ "L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as "
#~ "possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device."
#~ " If you have a lot of applications that do large amounts of random reads on "
#~ "a dataset small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be "
#~ "increased by adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if"
#~ " your working set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a "
