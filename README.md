# hello-world
This area will be used for ideas, personal projects, and testing purposes.
I wish to merge my advanced degree in analytical writing with my hobby of tinkering with FreeBSD and PC-BSD.
Documentation writing seems like a feasible area where I can utilize my education and talents to assist the open source community.
