<span id="id1"></span><h1>6. Changelog<a class="headerlink" href="#changelog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the major features and changes to each version of
Lumina, with the most recent version of Lumina listed first.</p>
<div class="section" id="lumina-0-9-0">
<span id="index-0"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>6.1. Lumina 0.9.0<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-9-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Created a &#8220;Common Applications&#8221; tab in the <span class="menuselection">Lumina Configuration Utility ‣ &#8220;Applications&#8221;</span>
section and moved common applications settings from the &#8220;File Defaults&#8221;
tab.</li>
<li>Changed the default wallpapers for Lumina/PC-BSD and added some more
4K Lumina wallpapers.</li>
<li>Updated <strong class="command">lumina-screenshot</strong>: Added a new quicksave option and
launch editor button for opening a full editor, windows to be snapshot
may now be clicked on for selection rather than using the list of open
windows, and screenshots may be cropped as needed within the utility
before saving them to a file.</li>
<li>Added new Utility: <strong class="command">lumina-textedit</strong>. This is a simple
plaintext editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace support, line
numbers, and bracket highlighting.</li>
<li>Updated the Lumina theme engine to no longer use stylesheets to modify
non-desktop applications (including the Lumina tools/utilities). This
opens the door for a full Qt5 theme plugin to be used for non-desktop
utilities instead.</li>
<li>Updated which XDG mime-types are used for the default web browser and
file manager. This should make it align a bit better with what
applications expect (if they try to read/use the database directly -
such as some popular web browsers do).</li>
<li>Updated Linux harddrive device detection (&#8220;nvme&#8221; devices).</li>
<li>Added Gentoo Linux support and an &#8220;ebuild&#8221; file.</li>
<li>Cleanup of some minor source syntax issues with Qt 5.6</li>
<li>Fixed a number of multi-monitor issues. Screen resizes/changes will
now be properly detected on the fly (on any system - including VM&#8217;s),
and panels will be placed properly on monitors not aligned with the
y=0 axis.</li>
<li>Ensured the current system volume gets saved on logout so it can be
reloaded on next login (in case the volume was changed by some
external tool during the session).</li>
<li>Added new startup binary: <strong class="command">start-lumina-desktop</strong>. This will
be used as the primary &#8220;entry point&#8221; for launching the desktop as
opposed to the &#8220;Lumina-DE&#8221; binary (please adjust your .xinitrc files
and wrapper scripts as needed). The xsession desktop entry that Lumina
installs was already changed to run this tool, so graphical desktop
managers should be unaffected by this change. This tool will
eventually be used to perform the X session setup/configuration
(so CLI users will not need to run <strong class="command">xinit</strong> or <strong class="command">startx</strong>
directly anymore), but the X integration has not been implemented yet.</li>
<li>Updated the FreeBSD appstore shortcut to point to the new
appcafe.desktop file from PC-BSD.</li>
<li>Cleaned many old shell scripts from the source tree (not needed for
builds any more).</li>
<li>Streamlined the build procedures slightly.</li>
<li>Reorganized the source tree. Now all the Lumina tools/utilities are
kept separate from the general build scripts/files within a <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">src-qt5</span></code>
directory, and additionally organized into categories (core,
core-utils, desktop-utils).
Automated build systems should not be impacted by this change, as the
main project file (lumina.pro) has been left in the same place within
the repository and just had all the internal paths adjusted
accordingly.</li>
<li>Updated all the installed desktop entries to use relative paths for
the icons (better cross-OS support).</li>
<li>Fixed the detection of &#8220;sloppy&#8221; URL&#8217;s given to lumina-open.</li>
<li>Adjusted one of the include files for the Lumina library so external
applications can now link against the lib without the availability of
the Lumina source tree (although still not recommended).</li>
<li>Stability fix for the desktop when an invalid desktop plugin is
set/registered.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lumina-0-8-8">
<span id="index-1"></span><span id="id3"></span><h2>6.2. Lumina 0.8.8<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-8-8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add 3 different view modes for applications in the start menu:
Alphabetical (no categories), Partial Categories, or Categories (need
to click the category to go into it and see the applications).</li>
<li>Make the symlink icon overlays a bit smaller at 1/3 icon size instead
of 1/2.</li>
<li>Add a new button for the audio controls to the left side of the
<span class="menuselection">Start ‣ Preferences</span> menu for muting and unmuting
audio.</li>
<li>The RPM spec for Fedora/CentOS has been refactored.  Within the limits
of supporting both Fedora and CentOS 7, 32-bit and 64-bit builds can
be done from the same spec, so that it complies with Fedora&#8217;s
guidelines on how a package should be structured.</li>
<li>Improvements to the notepad desktop plugin.</li>
<li>Redo the &#8220;App Menu&#8221; panel plugin so that it uses a self-contained menu
and lists the logout options at the bottom.</li>
<li>Fix sorting of &#8220;favorites&#8221; items in the &#8220;Start&#8221; menu to be sorted by
display name instead of file name.</li>
<li>Add new options for loading new wallpaper files in
<strong class="command">lumina-config</strong>: Single Directory (all images within the
directory) and Recursive Directory (all images in the selected
directory and all sub-directories).</li>
<li>Add support for selecting a ZFS snapshot by name, in addition to the
current time-slider.</li>
<li>NetBSD is now a supported build target.</li>
<li>Add the ability to change monitor resolutions in
<strong class="command">lumina-xconfig</strong>.</li>
<li>Add support for the Intel backlight, if available, on FreeBSD systems.</li>
<li>Fixed a translation bug for the Portuguese language.</li>
<li>Fix a crash on FreeBSD 11.x when removing a desktop icon.</li>
<li>Fix a multi-threading issue randomly causing <strong class="command">lumina-fm</strong> to
crash when opening a directory.</li>
<li>Fix some resize bugs with the custom resizeMenu class which is used by
the &#8220;Start&#8221; menu.</li>
<li>Multiple fixes for resolution detection as well as graphical glitches
that were causing menus to behave unpredictably.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lumina-0-8-7">
<span id="index-2"></span><span id="id4"></span><h2>6.3. Lumina 0.8.7<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-8-7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Convert everything to XCB and remove XLib dependencies.</li>
<li>Update DragonFlyBSD support.</li>
<li>Adjust build procedures to better support multiple concurrent threads
using the &#8220;-j&lt;#threads&gt;&#8221; <strong class="command">make</strong> option.</li>
<li>Add better relative path support for launching applications in the
mimetype database.</li>
<li>Add support for a new instance of a LuminaSingleInstance application
using the &#8220;-new-instance&#8221; CLI flag.</li>
<li>Add better fallback methodology for detecting and fixing stale
single-instance flags.</li>
<li>Now uses the Qt5-Concurrent build module for additional
multi-threading support in various utilities.</li>
<li>Add support for selecting a mouse cursor theme (requires session
restart).</li>
<li>Add new color schemes: Grey-Dark, Solarized-Light, Solarized-Dark, and
Blue-Light.</li>
<li>Customize the Lumina-default theme.</li>
<li>Add inheritance to theme files and convert the Lumina-default to
inherit the &#8220;None&#8221; theme.</li>
<li>Add support to <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-screenshot"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Screenshot</span></a> for multi-screen arrangements
and for including and excluding window borders for single window
snapshots.</li>
<li>Add support for various background image scaling and placement
options.</li>
<li>Add a number of new desktop shortcuts for the session. This requires
existing users to remove their <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.lumina/fluxbox-keys</span></code> before
logging in to get the new settings.</li>
<li>Clean up the panel activation and detection routines to better respond
to mouse-over events, particularly for auto-hidden panels.</li>
<li>Completely overhaul the desktop plugin container system. Now it is
completely drag and drop based with an intelligent grid of items and
locations. Right-click, or click and hold, an item to open a menu of
additional plugin configuration options. Note that any previous plugin
locations will be reset to their defaults during the update to this
new system.</li>
<li>Add support for dropping files and directories from other applications
onto the desktop, creating a symlink to the desktop folder when
appropriate.</li>
<li>Add font outlining to all desktop items so that the text is visible
even if the font color blends into the background image.</li>
<li>ZFS snapshot browsing is now seemlessly embedded within the directory
viewer of <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#insight-file-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Insight File Manager</span></a>.</li>
<li>Add support for either tabs or columns when viewing multiple
directories at once.</li>
<li>Replace the &#8220;Icon View&#8221; mode with the ability to adjust the icon sizes
as desired.</li>
<li>Add support for running the slideshow viewer and multimedia player in
the background as separate tabs. Add the ability to zoom in/out on a
slideshow image as desired.</li>
<li>Add full drag and drop implementation to Insight File Manager. Can
drag files and directories to external applications that support the
standard &#8220;text/urilist&#8221; Mimetype for drag and drop operations.</li>
<li>Directory and thumbnail loading is now a couple orders of magnitude
faster than before. The thumbnail loading routine is now a completely
separate background thread, preventing any delays in application
functionality while loading.</li>
<li>Add support for the &#8220;back&#8221; mouse button when viewing a directory.</li>
<li>Completely overhaul the <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-file-information"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina File Information</span></a> utility. Now it
is an almost complete front-end for the Qt/Lumina file information and
XDG entry structures.</li>
<li>Add support for detecting and allowing user-local Fluxbox themes in
addition to system-local themes.</li>
<li>Decrease initial loading time of <a class="reference internal" href="luminaconfig.html#lumina-configuration"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Configuration</span></a> by making
it load all the background image thumbnails on demand instead of
up-front.</li>
<li>Update the <a class="reference internal" href="luminaconfig.html#interface"><span class="std std-ref">Interface Configuration</span></a> used for panel configuration so that it is
much easier to read and use.</li>
<li>Update the application selection in the fileopen dialog of
<a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-open"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Open</span></a>, making it much easier to find the proper
application to open the specified file.</li>
<li>Overhaul the &#8220;Clock&#8221; panel plugin. Now it provides a menu with a
calendar as well as an option for the user to instantly switch the
time zone.</li>
<li>New &#8220;Start Menu&#8221; panel plugin is a Windows-esque system menu which
incorporates the functionality of both the user button and the system
dashboard in one place. This plugin also supports creating and
removing desktop links for applications, as well as &#8220;quick-launch&#8221;
buttons for adding applications to the panel.</li>
<li>Update the &#8220;Workspace Switcher&#8221; panel plugin so it stays in sync with
external changes to the current workspace.</li>
<li>New &#8220;Line&#8221; panel plugin provides a simple visual line to provide
separation between plugins.</li>
<li>Fix or bypass some Fluxbox window placement bugs.</li>
<li>Fix some bugs in the user button regarding file and directory
removals.</li>
<li>Clean up a number of built-in text strings for clarity and
consistency.</li>
<li>Ensure that graphical sliders for adjusting screen brightness only go
down to 10% to prevent the user from blacking out their screen
entirely.</li>
<li>Update the support for non-xterm terminal emulators to be opened
within a particular directory.</li>
<li>Update URL syntax handling in <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-open"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Open</span></a>.</li>
<li>Update support for sticky windows to appear in the task manager on all
workspaces.</li>
<li>Clean up a number of possible bugs with regards to how external
application might be launched or used. This fixes the random race
condition where a process finished but the thread in Lumina which
called it still thinks it is running.</li>
<li>Ensure that all calendar widgets on the desktop or panel update as
necessary to ensure the correct date is shown during multiple-day
sessions.</li>
<li>Add a small CLI flag to <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-open"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Open</span></a> for testing the crash
handler (&#8220;-testcrash&#8221;).</li>
<li>Ensure that on FreeBSD, the disk I/O information uses instantaneous
values instead of system averages.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lumina-0-8-6">
<span id="index-3"></span><span id="id5"></span><h2>6.4. Lumina 0.8.6<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-8-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add the ability to set system-locale overrides, used on login. This
allows the user to mix locale settings for the various outputs.</li>
<li>Add the ability to switch the locale of the current session on the
fly, changing all locale settings for the current session only. These
settings will be used when launching any applications within that
session.</li>
<li>Fix up the translation mechanisms so that everything is instantly
re-translated to the new locale.</li>
<li>More languages are now fully translated. Install the x11/lumina-i18n
port or pkg to install the localizations and enable these new
localization features.</li>
<li>Add support for the “Actions” extension to the XDG Desktop
specifications. This allows applications to set a number of various
actions, or alternate startup routines, within their XDG desktop
registration file. These actions are shown within Lumina as new
sub-menus within the &#8220;Applications&#8221; menu as well as in the &#8220;User&#8221;
button. Look for the down arrow next to the application&#8217;s icon.</li>
<li>Change the Lumina On-Screen-Display to a different widget, allowing it
to be shown much faster.</li>
<li>Add new <em>_ifexists</em> functionality to any session options in
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">luminaDesktop.conf</span></code>. This allows the distributor to more easily
setup default applications, such as the web browser or mail client,
through an intelligent tree of options.</li>
<li>Apply a work-around for new users which fixes a bug in Fluxbox where
the virtual desktop windows could still be changed or closed by
various Fluxbox keyboard shortcuts. If an existing user wants to apply
this fix, replace their <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.lumina/fluxbox-keys</span></code> with
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local/share/Lumina-DE/fluxbox-keys</span></code>. Note that this will
overwrite any custom keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Fix some bugs in the new window detection and adjustment routines with
full-screen apps that modify the X session settings.</li>
<li>Fix a couple bugs with the automatic detection and load routines for
the new QtQuick plugins.</li>
<li>Add in the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-X</span></code> keyboard shortcut for cutting items in the
<a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#insight-file-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Insight File Manager</span></a>.</li>
<li>Fix up the active reloading of icons when the icon theme changes.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lumina-0-8-5">
<span id="index-4"></span><span id="id6"></span><h2>6.5. Lumina 0.8.5<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-8-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The user button has received a significant speed boost, and can now be
used for browsing files and directories within the user’s home
directory.</li>
<li>Desktop icons have received a large number of changes in styling,
amount of visible text, and functionality. There is also a new feature
to automatically generate plugins for items in the user’s Desktop
directory, where each plugin may be individually moved/changed rather
than trapped within a container like the “desktopview” plugin.</li>
<li>Added a desktop plugin for monitoring the system hardware status such
as memory and CPU usage, CPU temperature, and disk I/O. This
functionality requires operating system support and is currently only
available for PC-BSD®, FreeBSD, and Debian.</li>
<li>Added a desktop plugin container for running custom QtQuick/QML
scripts. While there is only a single sample plugin of this type
available at the present time, it is now possible for users to create
their own custom interface plugins using the QML scripting language,
which is similar to JavaScript or CSS.</li>
<li>Lumina has been fully translated to German, Russian, and Spanish, and
almost-completely translated to Catalan (89%), Chinese (61%), Estonian
(53%), Indonesian (76%), Polish (89%), Portuguese (89%),
Portuguese-Brazilian (89%), Swedish (91%), and Turkish (88%).</li>
<li>The new system for desktop plugin settings requires that any desktop
plugins be reset back to defaults when upgrading to this version of
Lumina.</li>
<li>There is a known conflict between Qt 5.4+ and Fluxbox 1.3.7 which
prevents the “close” button from working on unlocked desktop plugins.
To work around this issue, right-click on the title for the plugin and
select the “close” option from the menu to remove the desktop plugin.
Alternatively, you may also remove desktop plugins using the
<a class="reference internal" href="luminaconfig.html#lumina-configuration"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Configuration</span></a> utility.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="lumina-0-8-4">
<span id="index-5"></span><span id="id7"></span><h2>6.6. Lumina 0.8.4<a class="headerlink" href="#lumina-0-8-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The panel has been improved to add support for mouse tracking,
variable-length panels that use a percentage of the screen edge
length, and the ability to pin the panel to a particular location on
the screen edge by either corner or centered.</li>
<li>Rescale the panel size if the monitor used in the previous session was
a different screen resolution.</li>
<li>For hidden panels, 1% of the panel size is visible on the screen while
it is hidden, rather than using a hard-coded pixel size. This is
better for high-resolution screens.</li>
<li>Remove the restriction that panels be on opposite screen edges.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-search"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Search</span></a> now supports the ability to change &#8220;Files or
Directories&#8221; search preferences on a temporary basis. New command-line
flags can be used to start searches instantly.</li>
<li>Search functionality has been integrated into the
<a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#insight-file-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Insight File Manager</span></a>. The <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-F</span></code> keyboard shortcut or
the “Search” menu option will start a search for a file or directory
with the current directory as the starting point.</li>
<li>A “Search” button has been added to the  home directory browser in the
user menu. This allows the user to easily start searching for a file
or directory within the selected directory.</li>
<li>The new “Favorites” system backend is much faster and more reliable
than the old system of symbolic links. Existing favorites should be
automatically converted to the new format when you log into the new
version of Lumina.</li>
<li>The <strong class="command">lumina-fileinfo</strong> utility can be used to view basic file
information, such as timestamps, owner/group information, file size,
and read/write permissions. If the file is an XDG
desktop shortcut that the user has permission to modify, this utility
provides the ability to make changes to that shortcut by
right-clicking on files in the desktop view plugin or within the
<a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#insight-file-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Insight File Manager</span></a> and selecting the “Properties” option.</li>
<li>Better application recommendations for files and URLs, especially for
web browsers or email clients.</li>
<li>Major cleanup of XCB library usage.</li>
<li>Hardware-brightness controls now used for PC-BSD® by default, if
supported by the system hardware.</li>
<li>Putting the system into the suspend state is now supported for PC-BSD®
and Debian.</li>
<li>New clock display formats.</li>
<li>A large number of session cleanup and session initialization
improvements, including resetting the user’s previous screen
brightness and audio volume settings.</li>
<li>New default keyboard shortcuts for tiling the open windows on the
screen, on new user configurations only.</li>
<li>Better support for the URL input format when required by an
application.</li>
<li>The user’s “log out” window appears much faster when activated.</li>
<li>There is a known bug in Lumina 0.8.4 regarding “unlocked” desktop
plugins. The close and maximize buttons for the plugin are
unresponsive when using Qt 5.4.1, preventing the user from easily
removing or maximizing a desktop plugin. As a temporary workaround,
right-click the titlebar for the unlocked plugin and select close or
maximize from the menu.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Add “Application Launcher” panel plugin which allows the user to pin
the shortcut for an application directly to a panel.</li>
<li>Add <a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#lumina-xconfig"><span class="std std-ref">Lumina Xconfig</span></a>, a graphical front-end to <strong class="command">xrandr</strong>.
This utility can be used to easily enable or disable additional
monitors and screens within the current desktop session. Shortcuts to
this utility are available in the user button plugin and the settings
menu plugin.</li>
<li>Fix the issue with transparent system tray icons on FreeBSD 11.</li>
<li>Add support for the XDG autostart specifications.</li>
<li>Fix a number of bugs related to detecting and using XDG mimetypes.</li>
<li>Add support for the XDG autostart specifications. More work is
necessary to convert the current Lumina autostart specification.</li>
<li>Add some additional fallback routines to account for possible errors
in <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.desktop</span></code> files.</li>
<li>Add support for creating new (empty) files using
<a class="reference internal" href="luminautl.html#insight-file-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Insight File Manager</span></a>.</li>
<li>Add an option for enabling and disabling the use of image thumbnails.
This is useful if you have massive image directories, just be sure to
disable thumbnails <strong>before</strong> loading the directory.</li>
<li>Add initial drag-and-drop support for moving files and directories
within a directory.</li>
<li>Load the specific icon for any application shortcuts.</li>
<li>Add the ability to view file checksums.</li>
<li>Add some additional checks and excludes for copy/move operations in
the background to prevent the user from performing illegal operations,
such as moving a directory into itself.</li>
<li>Add support for listing statistics about the current directory such as
number of files, total size of files, and percent of the filesystem
which is used.</li>
<li>Streamline the frequency of the background directory checker so that
it runs much less often.</li>
<li>Disable the shutdown/restart options on PC-BSD® if the system is in
the middle of performing updates in order to add an extra layer of
safety.</li>
<li>Have the shutdown/restart options use the “-o” option on FreeBSD and
PC-BSD® so that the system performs the action much faster.</li>
<li>Add support for thumbnails, increasing/decreasing icon sizes, removing
files, and  cut/copy files to the “desktopview” desktop plugin. This
plugin provides traditional desktop icons.</li>

application launcher desktop plugin.</li>
<li>Update the icon used for the “favorites” system in the user button and
the file manager.</li>
<li>Add the ability to display alternate timezones in the system clock.
This does <strong>not</strong> change the system time as it is just a setting for
the visual clocks/plugins.</li>
<li>Add a new panel plugin for pinning application shortcuts directly to
the panel. This is just like the “applauncher” desktop plugin, but on
the panel.</li>
<li>Perform the initial search for applications on the system within the
session initialization. This ensure that buttons and plugins are
responsive as soon as the desktop becomes visible.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with transparent system tray icons on FreeBSD 11 and
convert the system tray embed/unembed routines to use the XCB library
instead of XLib.</li>
