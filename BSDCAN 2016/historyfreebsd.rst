A Short History of FreeBSD
==========================

Rod Grimes

386BSD patchkit (pre-1994)

Everyone was patching and uploading, leading to conflict errors for everyone on the net. The idea began to have a centralized area were patches would be committed.
Walnut Creek CDROM was approached about making patch CDs, but hardware problems slowed the whole process
The first hostname was Freefall (a skydiving reference)
FreeBSD servers were originally located in Portland OR, but were moved in with Walnut Creek when they expanded their offices

About a dozen people were involved in putting together a patch kit.
Those involved voted on a list of names for the project.

An intial repository was created - cvs. Some in the project were familiar with cvs, but others had no experience at all.
Distribution was usually handled via floppy disks, as internet connection speeds didn't really allow 4MB downloads to be feasible.

Rod Grimes was responsible for the creation of the core team. He was not a technical expert in the BSD operating system.
Believes the core team was started at around 9 people, which it has still roughly remained to this day.
The first copy of FreeBSD 1.0 was spun at Walnut Creek CDROM. Rod Grimes has the "golden copy"
'92 in the Netherlands was sort of the first freebsd conference (sort of) NLUUG
At NLUUG, there was an attempt to merge NetBSD/FreeBSD, but met with failure
USL/Novell vs BSD lawsuit
More than one agreement - The CSRG version of the agreement is now public (wikipedia the FreeBSD lawsuit)
The agreement removed a large chunk of the core system as those bits were no propietary
4.4 lite became the release without the encumbered bits
A new repository was made - ncvs
Two initial versions of files (1.1.1)
Loss of easy access to history
loss of time to implement missing bits

How to mangle history - repository copies
A lot of jury rigging had to happen to move the repository and clean the encumbered data
How old is the amd64 code?
are you coming back to release engineering? never
