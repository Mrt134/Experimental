BSDCAN 2016 is an eclectic affair.
Informal, corporate, collegiate.

Held at Ottowa University, BSD CAN is a formal/informal gathering of developers, businesses, and interested parties, all under the banner of "open source".

A developer's summit starts the conference, Wednesday June 8.
Microsoft began with a presentation about Azure, Microsoft's growth effort into open-source computing.

Having just started a new technical writing job with iX Systems, 
I had never been to an open source computing conference, and was a little nervous about attending BSD Can, since my co-workers told me this was one of the largest conferences. 

I attended the developer's summit, listening to interesting presentations from Microsoft and Intel about software their companies were building that intersected with FreeBSD and the broader open source world. 
After lunch, the developer's summit broke into several working group sessions. I chose to attend the documentation working group meeting as I desired to learn as much as possible about FreeBSD documentation as I could. In this session, about a dozen contributors listened to a presentation (Warren Block) about FreeBSD documentation (see docdevsummit.rst). This session was more informal, with comments and questions welcomed freely in order to open broader discussions about strengths and weaknesses of the documentation efforts. The appearance and function of the documentation web site appeared to stimulate a rather spirited discussion. 

After an hour and a half, our group took a break to join the general session, where the conference T-Shirt was unveiled to much fanfare. 

June 9th

Got an early start by grabbing breakfast at a local restaurant. After a fine breakfast, arrived at the dev summit general session. The host began an interactive session to list the changes slated to go live with the impending FreeBSD 11.0 release. During this session, an online interactive notepad session was created so the developers in attendance could write in their own contributions to FreeBSD 11.0. After about an hour, a list of some <insert #> alterations was produced. Clearly, a for a community contributed project, FreeBSD has a significant amount of effort being put into it. After a short recess, once again the developers came together to offer a list of wanted features. Then, after a few minutes of listing desired features from <x> to <y>, focus was shifted to a listing changes or new features for FreeBSD that developers had that was available to the broader community. It was interesting to see a large number of developers freely showing or making code available to a broader community. As someone who has a background in studying political relationships, seeing a community come together to offer solutions/fixes/hacks/synonym in a free and open manner.
After lunch, the developers gathered outside for a group photo. 
Next, the rest of the afternoon was spent in hacking sessions, with the developers breaking off into smaller working groups to solve specific development issues in FreeBSD/each others' projects These sessions were very informal, with the developers pulling chairs into a circle to collectively brainstorm a problem or gathering around a couple of laptops or two in order to discuss the finer points of a piece of code or software. These sessions would tend to go on for hours, with a few even stretching all through the night.

General conference began.
Somewhere between one and two hundred people 
about a half dozen companies or vendors had produced display tables, offering the attendees a closer look at specific products or other 

Listened to 7 or 8 presentations
