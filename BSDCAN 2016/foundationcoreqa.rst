FreeBSD Core Team Q and A
=========================

.. look into getting names and pictures of the core team for the Q and A panel

Q: FreeBSD needs to recruit/evangelize younger audiences. FreeBSD should work with other vendors. FreeBSD needs to market more its advantages over other solutions.
A1: You are correct. Core has evolved to help and support people who want to do these things, but Core doesn't do these things themselves anymore.
A2: I got into FreeBSD in college, and would like to emphasize youth recruiting in colleges much more, please send suggestions to us.
A3: You are correct, we need to foster a more inclusive culture. Core needs to be better about getting community volunteered work done.
A4: teachbsd.org is one solution that has been provided by Core/Foundation members, but not necessarily as a function of those groups.
Audience note: Core has evolved into a project stewardship role, not project management.
A5: When Core tried to be more activist and steer the project, there is significant pushback from large portions of the community. A top-down approach to the Core has not worked any time it has been tried.
Audience note: If you want to change the approach, look into your voting options for the upcoming Core team election

Q: Core should be providing oversight of the Foundation in terms of resource management so that resources are used most efficiently.
A1: There is some overlap between Core and the Foundation, but Core guidance to the Foundation has not been an explicit role, and probably will not be.
A2: Last Core team, the Foundation would approach Core for guidance, and Core didn't know what to do.
A3: Core election candidates need to think about this issue as part of their functions in the Core Team.

Straw Poll: How many people think Core should be more active in steering the project?
About 1/3+ of the room raised their hands.
Core has several different roles that are mutually exclusive (legal, business, volunteer guidance, etc.)

A: FreeBSD is a very informal, ephemereal thing. Delegation is really the only thing Core can do outside its area of expertise.
Addition: Core often finds people aproach them asking permission from core to make changes to the FreeBSD system.
Audience Addition: Core spends more time cheerleading specific areas of the project that need improvement, and not so much work in that area. That has generally been the ability of core to manage development.
A2: Elect people to Core that are interested in the things you think are important.
